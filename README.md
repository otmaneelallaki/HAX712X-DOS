## French electricity consumption prediction

The following project aims to provide a forecast of the French electricity consumption on December 8, 2022.
More generally, the result of our work will allow you to forecast the consumption on the date you choose with a certain accuracy.
It will also be possible to forecast this consumption according to the source of electricity (nuclear and gas).

These predictions are based on very accurate and comprehensive data from the collaboration : Open Data Réseaux Énergies (ODRÉ).

The principal data show the consumption in Megawatt-hour of France each 30 minutes and precise the source of electricity.
It is available on https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/eco2mix-national-tr/information/?disjunctive.nature&sort=-date_heure

## Authors

The prediction was made by El Allaki Otmane and Sofiane Aoues.
You will also find a program made by David Czarnecki that produces choropleth maps of electricity consumption.
