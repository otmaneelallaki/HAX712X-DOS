## French electricity consumption prediction

The following project aims to provide a forecast of the French electricity consumption on December 8, 2022.
More generally, the result of our work will allow you to forecast the consumption on the date you choose with a certain accuracy.
It will also be possible to forecast this consumption according to the source of electricity (nuclear, wind and gas).

These predictions are made possible in part by obtaining very accurate and comprehensive data from the collaboration : Open Data Réseaux Énergies (ODRÉ).

The principal data show the consumption in Megawatt-hour of France each 30 minutes and precise the source of electricity.
It is available on https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/eco2mix-national-tr/information/?disjunctive.nature&sort=-date_heure

## Authors

The prediction was made by El Allaki Otmane and Sofiane Aoues.
You will also find a program made by David Czarnecki that produces choropleth maps of electricity consumption.

# Workplan

Each of us will take care of one of the two major objectives of the project, since there are three of us,  and there is more than one possibility to set an model that can be fitted to our time serier we decided to works in two models defferents :

Intermediate tasks will be handled jointly by all of us, depending on their relevance to our main workload.

David will take care of the card and its interfaces

Otmane will take care of the first model 

Soufian will take care of the secend Model

instructions for use and documentation will be completed as the project progresses.

The project will be presented in the form of an oral presentation and an explanatory beamer that will accompany our presentation.

## Instructions for use:
